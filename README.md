## Project Overview

This repository contains research code for **Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO)**  
applied to **continuous-time Merton–style consumption–investment problems** with:

- **single-asset** and **multi-asset** markets,
- **projection operators** (simplex / leverage constraints),
- and **Lyapunov critics** that enforce **safety constraints** such as
  wealth barriers and ruin avoidance.

The main idea is to combine

1. **Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP)** to shape the policy gradient via the Hamiltonian, and  
2. **Lyapunov-style value functions** to penalize unsafe wealth trajectories,

so that we obtain policies that are **near-optimal and safe** in high-dimensional asset spaces.

> **WIP:** The codebase is under active development. APIs and experiment scripts may change.

## Key Contributions

- **P-PGDPO for Merton-type models**  
  - Single-asset PG-DPO: PMP-guided updates for consumption \(c_t\) and portfolio weight \(\pi_t\).  
  - Multi-asset PG-DPO: projection layer (simplex) to handle long-only, fully-invested portfolios in \(d\)-dimensional markets.

- **Deep Lyapunov Critics for safety**  
  - A separate **LyapunovNet** learns a Lyapunov function \(V_L(t,W)\) that approximates
    the long-run accumulation of **safety costs** (wealth barrier + ruin).  
  - Actor loss includes:
    - **Lyapunov TD loss** (Bellman-style fit for \(V_L\)),  
    - **Lyapunov drift penalty** \( [V_L(t_{k+1},W_{k+1}) - V_L(t_k,W_k)]_+ \),  
    - **ruin penalty** when wealth approaches a ruin barrier.

- **Closed-form Merton benchmark**  
  - Single-asset: compare learned \(\pi(t,W)\) and \(c(t,W)\) to the analytical Merton solution  
    (constant optimal weight \(\pi^\star\) and Riccati-type optimal consumption ratio \(\kappa^\star(t)\)).  
  - Multi-asset: compare learned portfolio weights to the unconstrained Merton portfolio
    \(\pi^\star = \frac{1}{\gamma}\Sigma^{-1}(\mu-r\mathbf{1})\).

- **High-dimensional projected setting**  
  - Multi-asset experiments with up to \(d=64\) assets,  
  - covariance matrices generated on-the-fly and enforced to be positive semidefinite,  
  - **FastSimplexProjection** layer for efficient GPU-friendly projection to the simplex.

## Methodology

### 1. Mathematical framework

- **Model:** Continuous-time Merton consumption–investment problem with CRRA utility:
  \[
  dW_t = W_t\Big(r + \pi_t^\top(\mu - r\mathbf{1})\Big)dt - c_t\,dt
          + W_t \pi_t^\top \Sigma^{1/2} dB_t.
  \]

- **Objective:** maximize
  \[
  \mathbb{E}\Big[ \int_0^T e^{-\delta t}\,u(c_t)\,dt + \beta\,u(W_T)\Big],
  \quad
  u(x) = \frac{x^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}.
  \]

- **Single-asset PG-DPO:**
  - PolicyNet outputs \((\pi(t,W), \kappa(t))\) with \(c_t = \kappa(t)W_t\).  
  - Critic (ValueNet) approximates \(V(t,W)\); costate \(Y = \partial V / \partial W\) is obtained via autograd.  
  - Hamiltonian
    \[
    H(t,W,\pi,c,Y) = u(c) + Y\cdot\big(W(r + \pi(\mu-r)) - c\big).
    \]
  - Actor targets are defined by **gradient ascent on \(H\)**:
    \[
    \pi_{\text{target}} = \pi + \eta_\pi \frac{\partial H}{\partial \pi}, \quad
    c_{\text{target}}   = c   + \eta_c \frac{\partial H}{\partial c},
    \]
    and the policy is trained to regress to these PMP-guided targets.

- **Multi-asset PG-DPO:**
  - PolicyNet outputs raw weights, then applies **simplex projection** to enforce
    \(\pi_t \in \Delta^{d-1}\) (long-only, fully invested).
  - Hamiltonian gradient w.r.t. \(\pi\) plays the same role; targets are projected back onto the simplex.

### 2. Lyapunov critic and safety costs

- Define **instantaneous safety cost** \(s(W)\) using:
  - **wealth barrier** \(W_{\text{safe}}\),  
  - **ruin threshold** \(W_{\text{ruin}}\) (strongly penalized).
  \[
  s(W) = \alpha (W_{\text{safe}} - W)_+^2
       + \beta  (W_{\text{ruin}} - W)_+^2, \quad \beta \gg \alpha.
  \]

- **LyapunovNet** learns
  \[
  V_L(t,W) \approx \mathbb{E}\Big[\sum_{k\ge 0} \gamma_L^k\,s(W_{t+k}) \,\Big|\,W_t=W\Big]
  \]
  via a TD-like loss:
  \[
  V_L(t_k,W_k) \approx s(W_k) + \gamma_L\,V_L(t_{k+1},W_{k+1}).
  \]

- **Actor loss** includes:
  - Lyapunov TD loss (for training LyapunovNet),
  - Lyapunov drift penalty \(\mathbb{E}[(V_L(t_{k+1},W_{k+1}) - V_L(t_k,W_k))_+]\),
  - ruin penalty \(\mathbb{E}[s(W_{k+1})]\).

This makes the final policy **PMP-guided for optimality** while being **Lyapunov-guided for safety**.

# Usage
# 1. Single-asset PG-DPO with Lyapunov safety
python deep_lyapunov_merton.py --mode single --iters 2000

- This runs:

  - PMP-guided PG-DPO for the single-asset Merton problem,

  - Lyapunov critic with wealth barrier and ruin penalty,

  - contour plots of
    - learned \pi(t, W) vs analytic \pi^*
    - learned c(t, W) vs analytic c^*(t, W).
  - Outputs (figures, logs) are written under outputs_pgdpo/
# 2. Multi-asset Projected PG-DPO with Lyapunov safety
python deep_lyapunov_merton.py --mode multi --d 64 --iters 2000

This launches the multi-asset experiment:

  - long-only, fully invested portfolio via simplex projection,

  - PMP-guided updates using the multi-asset Hamiltonian,

  - Lyapunov critic and ruin penalty defined on total wealth,

  - contour plots for selected coordinates of π(t,W) and the consumption ratio.
